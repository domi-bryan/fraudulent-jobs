# Fraudulent Job Posting Detectors

A project to utilise Scikit-Learn library to predict whether a job posting is fraudulent or not

## Simple Models Considered

<ul>
    <li>
        K-Nearest Neighbours
    </li>
    <li>
        Logistics Regression
    </li>
    <li>
        SVM + PCA
    </li>
    <li>
        Decision Tree + PCA
    </li>
</ul>

## Ensemble Models
<ul>
    <li> 
        Random Forest Classifier
    </Li>
    <li>
        Ensemble Learning (Logistics and KNN, with Random Forest as final classifier)
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensemble Learning (Random Forest and KNN, with Logistics as final classifier)
    </li>
</ul>

## Possible Improvements

Use GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters (not done here due to hardware and time limitations)
